# Acknowledgements 
- The general design of the ConfusedCore *hmmm* processor takes heavy inspiration from the single and multi cycle RISC-V processors designed by Harris and Harris for *Digital Design and Computer Architecture - RISC-V Edition*. While the RISC-V and *hmmm* instruction set architectures are inherently very different and require unique design elements, my work on this processor would not have been possible without their book and educational processors therin.  
- Additionally, the extensive documentation of the *hmmm* ISA from the staff of CS5 at Harvey Mudd College (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~cs5grad/cs5/hmmm/documentation/documentation.html#Machine) was vital to the development of this project. A special thanks to all of those who contributed to this over the years.
